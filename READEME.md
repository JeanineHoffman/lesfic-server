###### <p>The user is able to search for something new to read by listing all books by specific authors or if the user prefers they can search for a book based on what sub-genre (under the genre of lesbian fiction) by using the drop down menu and selecting the genre. Future iterations will have a place for users to enter new books and authors to the DB with (hopefully) a check on spelling by confirming against Amazon or GoodReads. There is also a plan for the rating system to go live as well as accounts being set up to save searchs</p>
